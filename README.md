# audit-pricing

This is a test repo to audit [cryptocompare.com](https://www.cryptocompare.com/)'s historical pricing data. We want to ensure the historical data doesn't change from time to time.

We're using ava snapshots to check the data.

To test, clone the repo and run `npm install`, followed by `npm test`.
